# PCA

The goal of this project is to do a singular value decomposition (SVD)/ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on an image and reconstruct the image using different modes. After the initial given modes of 5, 10, and 20, more reconstructions were made by choosing modes that correspond with singular values that appear to decrease at a relative jump. When the picture appears to be visually identical to the original, the compression ratio and the size of the singular value matrix is determined.
